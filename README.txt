# Nimbus JOSE+JWT

Nimbus JOSE+JWT is a popular open source (Apache 2.0) Java library which implements the **Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)** spec suite and the closely related **JSON Web Token (JWT)** spec.

The library can create, examine, serialise and parse the following JOSE and JWT objects (in compact format):

* Plain (unsecured) JOSE objects.
* JSON Web Signature (JWS) objects.
* JSON Web Encryption (JWE) objects.
* JSON Web Key (JWK) objects and JSON Web Key (JWK) Sets.
* Plain, signed and encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

The repository has a new home at https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-jose-jwt
